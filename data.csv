0,Shape Of You,Ed Sheeran,3,0,"love, body, baby, lead, shape","The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast, and then we talk slow

And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put ""Van the Man"" on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say: ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new

Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
Oh, I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
But you and me are thrifty
So go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag, and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say: ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new

Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
Oh, I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new

Oh, I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
(Come on, be my baby, come on)
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on

Oh, I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you"
1,Rolling In The Deep,Adele,10,1,"deep, tears, heart, hands, scars","There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

I can't help feeling
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat."
2,Without Me,Halsey,12,2,"baby, sittin, high, sky, lonely","[Intro]
Without me, without me, yeah
Without me, without me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
I say I'd catch you if you fall
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you can take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Say I'd catch you if you fall
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you can take advantage of me

[Bridge]
You don't have to say just what you did
I already know
I had to go and find out from them
So tell me how's it feel (oh-woah)

[Chorus]
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there

3,Call Me Maybe,Carly Rae Jepsen,13,3,"number, bad, baby, crazy, way","I threw a wish in the well, don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell and now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish, pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this, but now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?

You took your time with the call, I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all, but still, you're in my way
I beg, and borrow and steal, have foresight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it, but it's in my way

Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?

Before you came into my life I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad
And you should know that, I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe?

4,Perfect,Ed Sheeran,15,4,"love, darling, perfect, baby, dark","I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot in the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, no I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"

Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she doesn't see what I see
But every time she asks me, do I look okay
I say

When I see your face
There is not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are, hey

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Oh, you know, you know
You know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay,
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There is not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"

Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin?
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth

And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough

Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""

And I just wanna tell you I am

Place your head on my beating heart

When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Oooooh, anymore

And I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door

Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without

I just need you now

(Whoa-whoa)

Guess I rather hurt than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one

And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with cuffs and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossin'
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for the closet

You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Verse 3]
I got my receipts, be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag,"" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, give me the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

You knew all my uncles and my aunts though

Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes

Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?

I just wonder what it's gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on lookin' back on better days

Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on, over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me, but you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not the broken hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter

52,Take Me To Church,Hozier,91,52,"church, good, dog, shrine, lies","My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

""We were born sick""
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

Clap that ass, you're the only one I love, clap that ass

Trap, TrapMoneyBenny
This shit got me in my feelings
I just gotta be real with it, yup

I'm just being real, my shit look..."
58,Wrecking Ball,Miley Cyrus,99,58,"ball, love, walls, lie, life","We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you in
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you, you wreck me
Yeah you, you wreck me"
